# 🚀 Alicia Cembranos | Pragmatic Software Engineer & Code Craftswoman 

## 💡 About Me
I'm a **pragmatic software engineer** passionate about building **scalable, maintainable, and user-centric applications**.  
I specialize in **backend development**, but my T-shaped profile allows me to **navigate the full stack** when needed.  

🛠️ **I craft code with care**, keeping software maintainable and readable while **avoiding unnecessary complexity**.  
👀 **Observability is my superpower**—I love understanding how my applications behave in production.  
🔁 **I iterate and experiment** to continuously refine products based on real user needs.  

## 🏆 Core Principles & Tech Stack  

💎 **Code Craftsmanship** – I embrace **TDD**, **clean architecture**, and pragmatic **design patterns**.  
🧩 **Hexagonal Architecture** – I design software for **adaptability** and **scalability**.  
🔎 **Observability-Driven Development** – I track, monitor, and optimize applications for reliability.  
🤖 **Exploring AI** – I’ve started **coding AI agents** and implemented **AI-powered features**.  
⚙️ **Pragmatism over Complexity** – Why force intricate design patterns when a simple controller does the job? Architecture should serve the code, not burden it.

## 🔥 Developer Mindset  
I take inspiration from **Martin Fowler**, **Cyrille Martraire**, **Kent Beck**, and **Valentina Jemuović**.  
My work thrives in **highly adaptable teams** that experiment, iterate, and push boundaries.  

💡 **T-shaped Engineer** – I dive deep into **backend architecture** but remain flexible across the stack.  
🛠️ **Frontend-Ready** – My past as a **frontend developer** gives me **full-stack adaptability**.  
🌱 **Always Learning** – AI, security, and scalable architectures are my current explorations.
