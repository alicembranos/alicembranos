   Hi, I'm Ali 👋🤓

### :woman_technologist: About Me :

I build scalable, maintainable software with a sharp focus on backend architecture and a T-shaped skill set. Over the past three years, I’ve worked across the stack but thrive in designing clean and pragmatic backend solutions.

I prioritize clarity over complexity, TDD for software quality, and observability for deep production insights. Drawing inspiration from Martin Fowler, Cyrille Martraire, and Kent Beck, I apply hexagonal architecture, leverage design patterns when needed, and keep my work user-centric.

To me, languages and frameworks are just tools—I adapt fast, pick up new technologies as needed, and focus on solving real problems, not just writing code in a specific stack.

Lately, I’ve been diving into AI-powered features and coding AI agents, always exploring new ways to push boundaries.

### 💡 What Drives Me:

🏗️ Craftsmanship & Software Quality – I see development as an evolving craft where attention to detail and continuous learning matter.

🧪 Experimentation & User Impact – I work in teams that iterate fast, experiment often, and thrive in a user-oriented mindset.

⚡ Adaptability & Versatility – With a frontend background, I can shift between backend and frontend as needed.

🎯 Autonomy & Ownership – I enjoy defining, implementing, and shipping features end-to-end while ensuring high quality.

### 🔥 My Tech Philosophy:

✔ Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Writing tests first for robust and maintainable code.
✔ Hexagonal Architecture – Ensuring flexibility and clean domain-driven design.
✔ Observability – Monitoring performance and gaining deep insights into systems.
✔ Design Patterns – Applying them only when complexity justifies it.✔ AI Exploration – Implementing AI-powered features and experimenting with AI agents.
